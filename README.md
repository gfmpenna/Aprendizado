# Practicing C++

I'm a beginner in the C++ language and I'm practicing to improve my knowledge and with that evolve my career as a Developer.
This is a basic project where I am using what I learned in language studies, I believe that I may have code that could be in another and better way, but the intention here is development and only with time will I achieve what is expected.
Thank you for understanding and if I have something I'm open to the idea.
Thanks.
